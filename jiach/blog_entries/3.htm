<p>
    Added Experiment about fluid layout. Learned and finished five experiments on this issue. 
    Each experiment added extra code to support more behaviors on different devices.
</p>
<p>
    The last experiment in fluid layout use what I learned to construct a 3-column layout. 
    This layout can change to a 2-column layout if the browser's width is between 480px-767px,
    and can change to single column layout when browser's width is less than 480px.

<p>
    Added Logo for home page and modified the css to support fluid layout.
